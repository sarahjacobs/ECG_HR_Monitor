# ECG_HR_Monitor
354 Final Project - Cardiac monitor that utilizes a 3-lead ECG signal that dynamically adjusts to ECG signal amplitude and produces an analog waveform and digital signal event. 
Features: Display with HR estimates for analog and digital input signals for instantaneous HR and running 1 minute average HR, LED that illuminates when 40 < HR < 180 bpm, LED that blinks if instantaneous analog and digital HR estimates deviate by more than 10%, pause button that pauses/resumes HR measurement, and a reset button that allows device to recalibrate itself to a new ECG signal with a different dynamic range and resets HR estimates. 

This project was created by Sarah Jacobs and Jocelyn Corey for Introduction to Medical Instrumentation.
